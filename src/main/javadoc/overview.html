    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    First thing you need to do is get testng-selenium on your class path.
    <br/>
    For maven users it's as easy as adding this to your dependencies:
    <br/>
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/jsdevel/9b3638c9a10472234e73.js"></script>
    <br/>
    In each of your suite classes, extend <code>AbstractSuite</code> like this:
    <br/>
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/jsdevel/a1b0bd45673077b997e4.js"></script>
    <br/>
    <code>AbstractSuite</code> provides suites with a <code>getPageFactory</code>
    method to create the page factories passed in as a type parameter.  In this example,
    the page factory passed as a generic type on line 7 is returned by
    <code>getPageFactory</code>.
    <br/>
    Now let's look at <code>MyPageFactory</code>:
    <br/>
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/jsdevel/ccf7b410397f3e59fddb.js"></script>
    <br/>
    Each method declared in a <code>PageFactory</code> should return a sub class of
    <code>Page</code>.  This allows testng-selenium to initialize your page objects,
    by doing some cool things, like navigating to them when <code>WebDriver</code>
    has been created.  See
    <a href="#pageInitializationPhase">Page Initialization</a> for more details.
    <br/>
    Ok, back to this page factory business.  How is testng-selenium able to construct
    a page factory from an interface?  Simple, Dynamic Proxies.
